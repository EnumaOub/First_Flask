# :bar_chart: Budget App
First application Flask which I want to evolve into an application to keep an eye on my budget.
It is mostly used for my expanses which is not easily use by another user.

Firstly based on https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/0.12.x/tutorial/introduction/

## :hammer_and_wrench: Learned

Flask: a micro web framework written in Python.
SQL/Postgre: to stock all data

CSS style: https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-admin-2
JQuery to add dynamic tables

## 	:desktop_computer: UI

We have an homepage as a dashboard showing the month expanses as well as an historic on another tab.
We can observe a set of random expanses and incomes.
